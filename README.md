# Student Attendance Tracking DAO

Welcome to the Student Attendance Tracking DAO project! This decentralized application (DAO) utilizes blockchain technology to streamline the process of tracking student attendance. Below are the steps to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) installed and running.
2. [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for compiling and deploying the smart contract.
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed for web3 dependencies.

### Installation Steps
1. **Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract:**
   - Open `AttendanceDAO.sol` in Remix IDE.
   - Compile the contract.
   - Deploy the contract using Ganache as the provider.

2. **Install Node.js and Configure Web3 Dependencies:**
   - Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to install web3 dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install web3 ganache-cli
     ```

3. **Configure the JavaScript Dashboard:**
   - Open `attendanceDashboard.js` and modify the following constants:
     - `contractAddress`: Set this to the deployed contract address.
     - `contractABI`: Set this to the contract ABI generated by Remix.

4. **Run the Dashboard:**
   - Open `attendanceDashboard.html` in your preferred browser.
   - Input a number between 0 and 9 to assign an address (0 for the teacher, others for students).
